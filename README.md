# [Project 1: Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors and the Gender Gap](https://github.com/drushton2020/Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors)
* Created a dashboard to visualize the earning of different college majors using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
* The report was done for the years between 2010-2012 and was published by the American Community Survey. 
* Effectively cleaned the data using Pandas and then used a variation of Graphs and Charts to focus mainly on the unemployment rate and the share of women per Major.
